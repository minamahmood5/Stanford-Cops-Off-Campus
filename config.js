Several students who were hit by police batons or rubber bullets criticized the LAPD for its use of force, saying that it did more to ignite conflict than stop it. In an interview, LAPD officials confirmed 15 official arrests and more than 20 people were treated at the UCLA Medical Center Emergency Room. The head of UCPD, Chief Clarence Chapman, agreed with Commander Tim McBride (spokesman for the LAPD) saying that the riots proved to police that early forceful responses are good.',

            description: 'Principal Investigator Jorja Leap (in collaboration with co-authors from the Luskin School of Social Welfare, Department of Anthropology and other UCLA data managers and researchers) released a report entitled &#8220;Evaluation of the LAPD Community Safety Partnership.&#8221; As is common in &#8220;reform&#8221; research, the report offered a <a href="https://luskin.ucla.edu/ucla-study-finds-strong-support-for-lapds-community-policing-program" target="_blank">positive</a> evaluation of CSP programs and recommended more money to the LAPD (not, notably, more money to the impoverished communities they are policing). This high profile report was immediately used by LA Mayor Eric Garcetti to justify millions of dollars directed toward the LAPD during the Summer of 2020 when a massive uprising for Black life was calling for precisely the opposite: defunding and divesting from policing, and investing in Black communities.

The basis for her firing were her political beliefs and membership in the American Communist Party. After protests over her firing and a court ruling, Davis resumed teaching, but was fired again in June 1970 for &#8220;<a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/08/home/davis-regents.html" target="_blank">inflammatory language</a>&#8221; in four different speeches.

Tabatabainejad was studying for finals in the library after hours and was asked to show his ID by a community service officer. He refused to do so, believing that he had been asked because of his Middle Eastern ethnicity. The community service officer called UCPD. When UCPD arrived, Tabatabainejad started to leave the library, but an officer grabbed his arm and he was handcuffed. The police then tasered him, continuing to do so even though he was handcuffed and had gone limp. After the incident, UCPD arrested and cited him for resisting and obstructing a police officer. Tabatabainejad filed a federal lawsuit alleging that the officers used excessive force and violated the ADA, which was settled with UCLA agreeing to pay <a href="https://laist.com/2009/05/18/ucla_taser_incident_lawsuit_settled.php" target="_blank">$220,000</a>.',
